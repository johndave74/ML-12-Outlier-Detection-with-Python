# ML-12-Outlier-Detection-in-Machine-Learning
In this repository, I will walk you through the task of outlier detection in machine learning. An outlier is a terminology commonly used by analysts and data scientists because it requires special attention, otherwise, it can lead to totally wrong estimates.

## 📊 Outlier Detection in Machine Learning: A Conceptual & Practical Guide

### 🚀 **Why This Project?**

Have you ever analyzed a dataset only to realize something feels… off? Maybe an employee’s salary reads **\$500,000** when others earn \$5,000, or a product review count jumps from **20 to 2,000 overnight**.

Those are **outliers**—and they **can distort your data’s truth** if left unchecked.

This notebook was created as an educational walkthrough to:
✅ Understand **what outliers are** and **why they matter**

✅ Explore **real-world causes of outliers**

✅ Learn **how they impact statistical measures** like mean and standard deviation

✅ Implement a **hypothesis testing approach** to detecting outliers using Python

Whether you’re a data science student or a machine learning practitioner, this notebook bridges **theory and practice**—so you not only detect outliers, but also understand the “why” behind the numbers.

## 📝 **What’s Inside This Notebook?**

This notebook blends explanations, examples, and code to guide you step-by-step:

1. **📖 Introduction to Outliers**

   * Clear definitions
   * Comparison table of data with vs. without outliers
   * Explanation of how outliers affect mean, median, and standard deviation

2. **🤔 Causes of Outliers**

   * Data entry errors
   * Measurement errors
   * Natural outliers

3. **🧠 Hypothesis Testing Approach**

   * Introduction to hypothesis testing for outlier detection
   * Steps involved: assumptions, criteria, test statistic, decision
   * Why hypothesis testing matters in a machine learning context

4. **👨‍💻 Practical Implementation**

   * Using **NumPy** and **SciPy** to run statistical tests
   * Code examples comparing two samples (with/without an outlier)
   * Interpretation of test results

## 🎯 **What You’ll Learn By The End**

✅ How outliers distort key statistics
✅ Common causes and real-world examples of outliers
✅ How to perform **hypothesis testing for outlier detection** in Python
✅ How to **interpret test results** and make decisions

This isn’t just about detecting a number—it’s about making better decisions with your data.

## 🔮 **What’s Next?**

In the next version, I plan to explore:
✅ Detection in **multivariate data** using Mahalanobis distance
✅ Visualization tools for spotting outliers
✅ Automating outlier detection pipelines for machine learning preprocessing

⭐ **Stay tuned and follow the repo for updates!**
